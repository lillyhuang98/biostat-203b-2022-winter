## Q1. Git/GitHub

**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.** We work with Git and GitHub. Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g., frequent and well-documented commits, is an important criterion for grading your homework.

1. Apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA email. You'll get GitHub Pro account for free (unlimited public and private repositories).

2. Create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2022-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and `maschepps` as your collaborators with write permission.

3. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Maintain two branches `main` and `develop`. The `develop` branch will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `main` branch will be your presentation area. Submit your homework files (R markdown file `Rmd`, `html` file converted from R markdown, all code and extra data sets to reproduce results) in `main` branch.

4. After each homework due date, teaching assistant and instructor will check out your main branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your `hw1` submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.

5. After this course, you can make this repository public and use it to demonstrate your skill sets on job market.

## Q2. Data ethics training

This exercise (and later in this course) uses the [MIMIC-IV data](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu), a freely accessible critical care database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. Follow the instructions at <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/> to (1) complete the CITI `Data or Specimens Only Research` course and (2) obtain the PhysioNet credential for using the MIMIC-IV data. Display the verification links to your completion report and completion certificate here. (Hint: The CITI training takes a couple hours and the PhysioNet credentialing takes a couple days; do not leave it to the last minute.)

**Solution:** verification link:

<https://www.citiprogram.org/verify/?ke7fb7cca-b5f2-4be2-a84b-687c2fe48c86-46748792>

## Q3. Linux Shell Commands

1. The `/mnt/mimiciv/1.0` folder on teaching server contains data sets from MIMIC-IV. Refer to the documentation <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/> for details of data files.  

    ```{bash, eval=F}
    ls -l /mnt/mimiciv/1.0
    ```

Please, do **not** put these data files into Git; they are big. Do **not** copy them into your directory. Do **not** decompress the gz data files. These create unnecessary big files on storage and are not big data friendly practices. Just read from the data folder `/mnt/mimiciv/1.0` directly in following exercises. 

    Use Bash commands to answer following questions.

2. Display the contents in the folders `core`, `hosp`, `icu`. Why are these data files distributed as `.csv.gz` files instead of `.csv` (comma separated values) files? Read the page <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/> to understand what's in each folder.

    **Solution:** 
    
    Content of folder `core` is

    ```{bash}
    ls -l /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core
    ```

    Content of folder `hosp` is

    ```{bash}
    ls -l /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/hosp
    ```
    
    Content of folder `icu` is

    ```{bash}
    ls -l /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/icu
    ```
The reason that the files were named as `.csv.gz` instead of `.csv` is because the files were compressed.

---
3. Briefly describe what bash commands `zcat`, `zless`, `zmore`, and `zgrep` do.

    **Solution:** 
    `zcat` is for uncompress the data,`zmore` is for browsing for a compressed     file for one screen at a time, `zless` is a pager for compressed files,        `zgrep` is for searching something in compressed files.


4. What's the output of following bash script?    
    ```{bash, eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/*.gz
      do
        ls -l $datafile
      done
    ```
    
    **solution:** 
    
    The above output list all .gz files in the core.
    

    Display the number of lines in each data file using a similar loop.

    **solution:**
    
    ```{bash, eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/*.gz
      do
        zcat $datafile | wc -l
      done
    ```

5. Display the first few lines of `admissions.csv.gz`. How many rows are in this data file? How many unique patients (identified by `subject_id`) are in this data file? (Hint: combine Linux commands `zcat`, `head`/`tail`, `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and so on.)
    
    **solution:**
    
    ```{bash, eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
        zcat $datafile | head -10
      done
    ```

    ```{bash, eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
        zcat $datafile | wc -l
      done
    ```


    ```{bash eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
         zcat $datafile | awk -F, '{ print $1 }' | tail -523740 | uniq | wc -l
      done
    ```



6. What are the possible values taken by each of the variable `admission_type`, `admission_location`, `insurance`, and `ethnicity`? Also report the count for each unique value of these variables. (Hint: combine Linux commands `zcat`, `head`/`tail`, `awk`, `uniq -c`, `wc`, and so on.)

    **Solution:** 
    The value for `admission_type` is $6, for `admission_location` is $7, for `insurance` is $9, for `ethnicity` is $12.
    
    
    The count for unique value of `admission_type`
    
    ```{bash eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
         zcat $datafile | awk -F, '{ print $6 }' | tail -523740 | uniq -c | wc -l
      done
    ```
   
    The count for unique value of `admission_location`
    
    ```{bash eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
         zcat $datafile | awk -F, '{ print $7 }' | tail -523740 | uniq -c | wc -l
      done
    ```
    
    The count for unique value of `insurance`

    ```{bash eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
         zcat $datafile | awk -F, '{ print $9 }' | tail -523740 | uniq -c | wc -l
      done
    ```
    
    The count for unique value of `ethnicity`

    ```{bash eval=F}
    for datafile in /mnt/mimiciv/1.0/core/admissions.csv.gz
      do
         zcat $datafile | awk -F, '{ print $12 }' | tail -523740 | uniq -c | wc -l
      done
    ```
    
    
## Q4. Who's popular in Price and Prejudice

1. You and your friend just have finished reading *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. Among the four main characters in the book, Elizabeth, Jane, Lydia, and Darcy, your friend thinks that Darcy was the most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Elizabeth. Obtain the full text of the novel from <http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt> and save to your local folder. 
    ```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
    ```
Explain what `wget -nc` does. Do **not** put this text file `pg42671.txt` in Git. Complete the following loop to tabulate the number of times each of the four characters is mentioned using Linux commands.

    **Solution:** 
    
    `wget -nc` download the file from the webpage.
    
    ```{bash eval=F}
    wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
      for char in Elizabeth Jane Lydia Darcy
        do
          echo $char:
          ls | grep $char pg42671.txt | wc -l
        done
    ```


2. What's the difference between the following two commands?
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt
    ```
    and
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt
    ```


    **Solution:** 
    
    The first command create the file `test 1.txt` with adding in `hello, world` text in, the second command create the file `test 2.txt` with adding in `hello, world` ,but when run multiple times the second command, there will be multiple times adding of the text to the file depends on the times of running command which means append the comand text to the file.


3. Using your favorite text editor (e.g., `vi`), type the following and save the file as `middle.sh`:
    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    ;#!/bin/sh
    # Select lines from the middle of a file.
    # Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
    head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
    ```

    Using `chmod` make the file executable by the owner, and run 

    ```{bash eval=FALSE}
    chmod g+x middle.sh
    chmod 751 middle.sh
    ./middle.sh pg42671.txt 20 5
    ```
Explain the output. Explain the meaning of `"$1"`, `"$2"`, and `"$3"` in this shell script. Why do we need the first line of the shell script?

    **solution:**
    The output is using the editor to type the command in the text and save it as a file `middle.sh`. Then the second        command is to make the file executable by the owner by setting the permission and displays `pg42671` file with end       lines of 20 and number lines of 5 `"$1"` means `filename` variables, `"$2"` means `endl_line` variables , and            `"$3"`means `num_lines` variables.The first line of the shell script `#!/bin/sh` is needed because it tells the          systems to operature the script by using `bin/sh` as the interpreter.

### Q5. More fun with Linux

Try following commands in Bash and interpret the results: `cal`, `cal 2021`, `cal 9 1752` (anything unusual?), `date`, `hostname`, `arch`, `uname -a`, `uptime`, `who am i`, `who`, `w`, `id`, `last | head`, `echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}`, `time sleep 5`, `history | tail`.

     **Solution:**
     `cal` is for the current month calender
     `cal 2021` is for the calender in 2021
     `cal 9 1752` is for calender in september in 1752, some days are missing in the calender
     `date` is for the date of today with time zone
     `hostname` is for the name of the server
     `arch` is for the computer's system
     `uname -a` is for the current using computer's system, name, and information.
     `who am i` is for the username of user
     `who`is for displaying who logged in the server
     `w` is for displaying the information who logged in the server and what they are doing.
     `id` is for displaying uid and gid and groups
     `last | head` is for listing the information of first 10 users who logged in to the server
     `echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}` is for listing all the possibilites of combination of each components in {}
     `time sleep 5` if for pause command for 5 seconds
     `history | tail` is for listing the 10 last used commands
